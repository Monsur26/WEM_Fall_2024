Rules of abstraction
 No objects can be created
 Variables must be initialized
 Methods must not have any implementation ie no method body

 what is the difference between an abstract class and an interface

    1. Abstract class is not 100% abstract.
    2. Abstract class allows both instatiated and non-instantiated variables.
    3. Abstract class requires a method to be decalred with a keyword
    'abstract' in order to make it without implementation ie method nody.

    1. Inteface is 100% abstract
    2. It does not allow variables without instantiated ie without values.
    3. All the methods are by default abstract meaning no method implementation ie no method body.
